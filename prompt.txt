Create a FastAPI server that accepts a POST request with location details (latitude and longitude) in the request body.

Validate the incoming data using Pydantic (latitude and longitude must be valid floats within range).
Use these coordinates to call the Open-Meteo API (hardcoded URL: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast) to fetch the temperature and humidity for the current day.
Receive the structured JSON response from Open-Meteo.
Pass this JSON to Gemini (Use Client for it) free-tier LLM (GEMINI-1.5-FLASH)(via REST API call using the placeholder GEMINI_API_KEY loaded from .env).
Receive a human-like summarized weather report from Gemini.
Return the summarized response as JSON to the client.
